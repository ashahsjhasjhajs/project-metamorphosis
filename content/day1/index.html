      <p>Okay, so today, I didn't do much. Actually I think I did. It was a wonderful day full of intense learning thanks to Aion :) and since I was up and couldn't sleep at night, I decided to spend some time visualizing how I want this
      site to look like and then spent a few hours updating it. I am still very far from done and have run into some unprecedented
    problems, such as my display image not showing in browser. same with the iframe thing. They aren't working. :/ I mean, i can see the border and can even style it but it won't let me
  see the image. I have no idea why and currently I am too tired to go on.. So I am leaving it for tomorrow. :) So day 1 of 77 done and dusted! </p>
